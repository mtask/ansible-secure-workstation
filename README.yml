## Basic Usage

### Initial Setup

* Check inventory and `roles/workstation-hardening/defaults.yml`
* Run `ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts workstsation.yml`
* copy `/var/lib/aide/aide.db` to offline media like external USB drive

### Upgrading system

* Optionally run `sudo ./helper-scripts/aide-check.sh` before upgrade. This allows checking if there are any unexpected changes before upgrade potentially changes multiple files.
* Run `ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts update-system.yml`. This upgrades system using `apt upgrade` and re-creates AIDE database to `/var/lib/aide/aide.db`.

### Update AIDE with other changes

* Run `ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts update-aide.yml` whenever there are controlled changes with system that were not caused by `update-system.yml`. This playbook only ugrades AIDE database.

### Auditing system

* Run `sudo ./helper-scripts/audit-today.sh` for summary report of auditd events. See `man ausearch` and `man aureport` for detailed event information.

### Backups

The main playbook `workstation.yml` installs backup script and configuration for rsnapshot.
